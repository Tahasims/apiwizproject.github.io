                        Agriculture began independently in different parts of the globe,<br> and included a diverse range of taxa. At least eleven separate regions of the
                         Old and New World were involved as independent centers of origin. <br>
                        The development of agriculture about 12,000 years ago changed the way humans lived. They switched from nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyles to permanent settlements and farming <br>
                        Wild grains were collected and eaten from at least 105,000 years ago.

                        describes the farming practices, crops, technology, and agricultural society and economy of Europe from the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 to approximately 1500. 
                        The Middle Ages are sometimes called the Medieval Age or Period.
                         The Middle Ages are also divided into the Early, High, and Late Middle Ages. The early modern period followed the Middle Ages. <br>
                         medieval system of agriculture began to break down in the 14th century with the development of more intensive agricultural methods .

            <p id="container" class="header2">Types of agricultural technology.</p>
            <h2 class="types">
                <ul>
                    <li>Agricultural drone.</li> <br>
                    <h3 class="tex">An agricultural drone is an unmanned aerial vehicle used in agriculture operations, mostly in yield optimization and in monitoring crop growth and crop production. Agricultural drones provide information on crop growth stages, crop health, and soil variations.
                         Multispectral sensors are used on agricultural drones to image electromagnetic radiation beyond the visible spectrum, including near-infrared and short-wave infrared. 
                        <br> <br>LEGALITY  <br><br>As drones entered use in agriculture, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) encouraged farmers to use this new technology to monitor their fields. However, with the unexpected boom of agricultural drones, the FAA quickly retracted such encouragement, pending new rules and regulations. With incidents such as drones crashing into crop dusters, the FAA and the AFBF (American Farm Bureau Federation) began discussions to agree on regulations that would allow the beneficial use of such drones in a safe and efficient manner. <br>
                         <br>SECURITY AND ETHICS  <br><br> The use of agricultural drones has ethical and social implications. One benefit is that they are able to monitor and control the use of pesticides properly. This allows minimizing the environmental impact of pesticides. However, drones do not require permission to fly over another person's property at altitudes of under 400 feet (120Â m). They may have microphones and cameras attached, and the resulting concern for potential privacy violation has caused some opposition towards drones. <br>
                         <br>FUTURE USE <br> <br> There is a large capacity for growth in the area of agricultural drones. With technology constantly improving, imaging of the crops will need to improve as well. With the data that drones record from the crops the farmers are able to analyze their crops and make educated decisions on how to proceed given the accurate crop information. Software programs for analyzing and correcting crop production have the potential to grow in this market. Farmers will fly a drone over their crops, accurately identify an issue in a specific area, and take the necessary actions to correct the problem. <br>

                    <li>Satellite photography and sensors.</li><br>
                    <h3 class="tex">Satellite images (also Earth observation imagery, spaceborne photography, or simply satellite photo) are images of Earth collected by imaging satellites operated by governments and
                         businesses around the world. Satellite imaging companies sell images by licensing them to governments and businesses such as Apple Maps and Google Maps. 
                        <br><br>HISTORY <br><br>The first images from space were taken on sub-orbital flights. The U.S-launched V-2 flight on October 24, 1946 took one image every 1.5 seconds. With an apogee of 65 miles (105Â km), these photos were from five times higher than the previous record, the 13.7 miles (22Â km) by the Explorer II balloon mission in 1935. <br>
                        The first satellite (orbital) photographs of Earth were made on August 14, 1959 by the U.S. Explorer 6. <br>
                        The first satellite photographs of the Moon might have been made on October 6, 1959 by the Soviet satellite Luna 3, on a mission to photograph the far side of the Moon. The Blue Marble photograph was taken from space in 1972, and has become very popular in the media and among the public. Also in 1972 the United States started the Landsat program, the largest program for acquisition of imagery of Earth from space. In 1977, the first real time satellite
                         imagery was acquired by the United States's KH-11 satellite system. The most recent Landsat satellite, Landsat 9, was launched on 27 September 2021. <br>
                         All satellite images produced by NASA are published by NASA Earth Observatory and are freely available to the public. Several other countries have satellite imaging programs, and a collaborative European effort launched the ERS and Envisat satellites carrying various sensors. There are also private companies that provide commercial satellite imagery. In the early 21st century satellite imagery became widely available when affordable, 
                         easy to use software with access to satellite imagery databases was offered by several companies and organizations. <br>
                         <br><br>USES <br> <br>Satellite images have many applications in meteorology, oceanography, fishing, agriculture, biodiversity conservation, forestry, landscape, geology, cartography, regional planning, education, intelligence and warfare. Less mainstream uses include anomaly hunting, a criticized investigation technique involving the search of satellite images for unexplained phenomena. <br>
                         Images can be in visible colors and in other spectra. There are also elevation maps, usually made by radar images. Image interpretation and analysis of satellite imagery is conducted using specialized remote sensing software. <br>
